Project 1: Recipes

This project is a rudimentary recipes site replete
with 3 carefully curated recipes presented with 
an image representation, description, ingredients, 
and, of course, preparattion steps. 

In this project I implemented skills in setting
up the HTML boilerplate, creating links to other
pages within and without my website, adding images
to webpages, using ordered and unordered lists, and
finally, effective utilisation of git (from writing
effective commit messages to pushing entire projects.)
