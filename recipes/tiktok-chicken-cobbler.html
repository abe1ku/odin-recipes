            <li>1 (11.35 ounce) package Cheaddar bay biscuit mix</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375°F
                <br>(190°C). Place butter in the bottom of a 9x13-inch<br>
                baking dish and place in the oven to melt.
            </li>
            <li>
                When butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer<br> 
                over the buter. Top evenly with frozen veggies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir together biscuit mix, seasoning packet from the<br>
                mix, and milk in a bowl until well blended; pour over<br>
                the chicken and veggies. Spread lightly and evenly<br>
                over the top of the mixture but do not stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until<br>
                smooth. Pour over biscuit mix but do not stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven uncovered until very golden<br>
                brown and only very slightly jiggly in the center, about<br>
                45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle parsley over the top if desired and let stand<br>
                for 10 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
